# Deploying an eCorpus instance

> This section requires some familiarity with common development tools: [git](https://git-scm.com/), [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/).

### Quick Installation

This section provides an example of creating a minimal instance of eCorpus for testing purposes. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Clone the eCorpus repository using the following command:
    ```
    git clone --filter=blob:none git@github.com:Holusion/eCorpus
    ```
2. Navigate to the eCorpus directory:
    ```
    cd eCorpus
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    npm i
    (cd source/server && npm i)
    (cd source/ui && npm i)
    ```
4. Build the user interface and server:
    ```
    npm run build-ui
    npm run build-server
    ```
5. Start the server:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

> Note: For an alternative installation method using Docker, refer to the installation documentation.

After completing the above steps, open a browser and navigate to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to access the eCorpus instance.

### Creating the first user account

When the application is launched, it is in "open mode", which allows you to create a first user account via the command line. To create an account, follow these steps:

1. Start your local server.
2. Open another terminal and run the following command:
    ```
    curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"<...>", "password":"<...>", "email":"<...>", "isAdministrator": true}' "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users"
    ```
    Replace `<...>` with your desired username, password, and email address.
3. Other accounts can be created via the web interface.

### Going further

After creating your first user account, navigate to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and log in. From there, you can create your first scene by following the instructions provided in the [Voyager import tutorial](/fr/doc/tutorials/voyager/import).

If you want to edit the source code, refer to the [development guide](/fr/doc/guides/development).

To configure your new instance, consult the [configuration documentation](/fr/doc/references/administration/configuration).
