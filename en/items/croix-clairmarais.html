        <p>
          Obverse: Three cross-shaped compartments, each inscribed in a quatrefoil, are arranged on the shaft of the cross. Only the central compartment has preserved the two pieces of the True Cross: the other two have been filled with a series of beads.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            According to legend, the Clairmarais reliquary cross was created to hold the relics of the True Cross brought back from the Holy Land by the Count of Flanders Thierry d'Alsace, founder of the Cistercian Abbey of Notre-Dame de Clairmarais.
        </p><p>
            After the abbey's suppression in 1791, the heirs of the last abbot who had retrieved the object sold it to Mr. Lefèvre-Hermand, who donated it to the confraternity of Notre-Dame-des-Miracles in Saint-Omer. Classified as a historical monument on May 11, 1897, it has been on deposit at the Musée de l'Hôtel Sandelin since 1979.          
        </p>
        <h2>Condition</h2>
        <p>
            The condition is good.
            The filigree obverse has suffered less than the reverse, which shows notable alterations and losses: entire portions of the beaded border and four granulation rosettes on the rings have disappeared.
        </p><p>
            The niello decoration on the lateral and upper ends is heavily oxidized and the medallion under the feet of Christ is heavily damaged.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Iconography</h2>
        <p>
            At the intersection of the lower traverse, the crucified Christ, with closed eyes and a bowed head, is attached by four nails, while his wounds let thin streams of blood flow. Everything seems to indicate here that he has just expired.
        </p><p>
            From his head sprouts a long bifid stem terminating in palmettes, which establishes a visual link with the Salvator Mundi, inscribed in a mandorla, in the upper register. At his feet, the resurrected Adam rises from his open tomb, his face directed upwards.
        </p><p>
            The ends of the lower traverse bear, on the other hand, representations of the Virgin and the Apostle John - with the characteristic affliction of the Crucifixion - while the remaining four medallions present the evangelists at their lecterns.
        </p>
