        <h2>Medieval goldsmithing put to the test of digital modeling</h2>
        <p>
          The E-Thesaurus project was born from reflections led by C. Descatoire, chief curator at the Cluny Museum, and M. Gil (IRHiS, ULille), along with two other specialists in goldsmithing, P. George (Trésor de Liège), and F. Tixier (University of Lorraine), on the occasion of the exhibition "<a href="https://hal.univ-lille.fr/hal-01610653" title="Une renaissance. L’art entre Flandre et Champagne 1150-1250  (Paris, musée de Cluny, Saint-Omer, musée de l’hôtel Sandelin, Avril-Juillet 2013)">Une renaissance</a>", organized at the Cluny Museum in Paris and the Hotel Sandelin Museum in Saint-Omer in the spring of 2013.

          On the occasion of this exhibition, a finding was made: Northern goldsmithing of the 12th-13th centuries had produced great masterpieces, some of which, significant witnesses to the talent of Northern goldsmiths, were preserved in Hauts-de-France.
        </p><p>
          However, unlike medieval Southern goldsmithing, well-known to the general public thanks to the Limoges enamels, that of the Northern regions was only truly known to specialists and had never benefited from the establishment of an international online corpus, unlike Southern enamels or, in another field, Gothic ivories.
        </p>
        <p>
          This art and technique history project aims to study Northern goldsmithing of the 12th-13th centuries, with a major focus on 3D modeling and augmented reality restitution of objects, two essential contributions for a better understanding of assembly techniques and, combined with physicochemical analyses, the manufacturing techniques of objects and their materials. The information thus collected will feed into an online database where informative and analytical data will be associated with 3D models of the studied elements. Additionally, the project will help to better showcase these works through a virtual exhibition, commented on from a technical manufacturing aspect.
