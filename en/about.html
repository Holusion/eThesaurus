        <h2>E-Thesaurus</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            The E-Thesaurus project was born from the reflections of C. Descatoire, chief curator at the Cluny Museum, and M. Gil (IRHiS, ULille), along with two other specialists in goldsmithing, P. George (Treasury of Li√®ge), and F. Tixier (University of Lorraine), on the occasion of the exhibition "A Renaissance. Art between Flanders and Champagne 1150-1250," which C. Descatoire and M. Gil organized at the Cluny Museum in Paris and the Sandelin Museum in Saint-Omer in the spring of 2013. A finding was made: the northern goldsmithing of the 12th-13th centuries had produced great masterpieces, some of which, significant witnesses of the talent of the Northern goldsmiths, were preserved in Hauts-de-France. However, unlike medieval southern goldsmithing, well known to the general public thanks to the Limoges enamels, that of the northern regions was truly only known to specialists and had never benefited from the establishment of an international online corpus, unlike southern enamels or, in another field, gothic ivories.

            This project, which focuses on the history of art and techniques, aims to study the northern goldsmithing of the 12th-13th centuries, with a major focus on modeling (3D) and augmented reality restitution of objects, two essential contributions for a better understanding of assembly techniques and, associated with physico-chemical analyses, the techniques of manufacturing objects and their materials. The information thus collected will feed a database, accessible online, where informative and analytical data will be associated with 3D models of the studied elements. In addition, the project will better publicize these works through a virtual exhibition, commented on the technical aspects of fabrication.
